    <h1>Kartini's legacy</h1>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Kartini’s letters were first collected and edited by J. H. Abendanon and
        published in Holland in 1911 as Door Duisternis Tot Licht (Through
        Darkness to Light). An English language version followed in 1920 under
        the (unfortunate) title, Letters of a Javanese Princess, and
        translations were later released in Malay (1922), Arabic (1926),
        Sundanese (1930), Javanese (1938), Indonesian (1938) and Japanese
        (1955). While this initial collection to ten interlocutors was edited
        (even censored) to protect the sensitivities of her close family,
        unabridged collections of Kartini’s letters (as well as those of her
        four younger sisters) have been translated into English by Joost Coté in
        recent decades.

        They include Letters from Kartini: An Indonesian Feminist, 1900-1904
        (1992) – to Rosita Abendanon-Mandri; On Feminism and Nationalism:
        Kartini’s Letters to Stella Zeehandelaar 1899-1903 (2005); Realizing the
        Dream of R. A. Kartini: Her Sisters’ Letters from Colonial Java (2008);
        Kartini: The Complete Writings 1898-1904 (2015). The letters map a
        period of growing emotional maturity, difficult choices and insightful
        reflection, alongside awareness of an emerging more enlightened colonial
        policy – the Ethical Policy — that supported greater education and a
        greater governing role for Indonesians, as well as implementation of
        agricultural improvements and development of an indigenous handicraft
        export industry.

        Kartini’s access to Western education and absorption of the
        Enlightenment ideals of social equality and freedom led her to the
        conclusion that changes had to be made in Javanese society, particularly
        in regard to colonisation.In a letter to Stella, dated 13 January 1900,
        perhaps in response to questions from Stella on the topic, she writes: I
        am very, very fond of the Dutch people, and I am grateful for much that
        we enjoy from them and because of them. Many, very many, of them we can
        call our best friends, but there are also very, very many who are
        hostile towards us for no other reason than that we dared to compete
        with them in terms of education and culture. They make this clear to us
        in very painful ways. ‘I am European, you are Javanese’ or, in other
        words, ‘I am the conqueror, you are the conquered’. Not just once, but
        several times, we are spoken to in broken Malay even though the person
        knew very well that we could speak the Dutch language…. Why is it that
        so many Hollanders find it unpleasant to converse with us in their own
        language? Oh, now I know, Dutch is too beautiful to be uttered by a
        brown mouth. (On Feminism and Nationalism 50)
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same letter Kartini expresses outrage at the inequalities and
        discrimination imposed by the system of apartheid that both exploited
        and humiliated but which, at the same time, relied on the Javanese
        aristocracy to maintain power. Oh! Stella, I have had the opportunity to
        observe all kinds of situations in the Indies society, and as a matter
        of course I have looked behind the conventions of the world of public
        officials. There are ravines there so deep, Stella, that the very sight
        of them would make you dizzy! Oh God! The world is so full of misdeeds,
        full of such horrible atrocities! (50-51) By 1900, Kartini was
        articulating a view that change for the Javanese would come with
        education, for ‘when the Javanese is educated he will no longer say
        “yes” and “amen” to everything that his superior chooses to impose on
        him’ (52).
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to explain the need for eventual emancipation, she makes a
        direct comparison between Javanese resistance to colonial domination and
        feminist resistance to patriarchal oppression in Europe: Here it is just
        as with the women’s movement with you, the Javanese are emancipating
        themselves. And in the same way that your women and girls are being
        opposed by those who have been their masters for centuries, here the
        Javanese are being hindered in their development by their superiors.
        Here it is only just beginning. … The battle will be fierce: the
        fighters will not only have to cope with their opponents but also the
        indifference of their own compatriots for whom they are taking up arms.
        And when the battle for emancipation of our men is in full flight, then
        the women will rise up. Poor men, what a lot you will to put up with.
        [One line was erased for the 1911 publication.] Oh! How wonderful that
        we happen to be living in these times! In this period of transition from
        the old to the new. (52-3) While Kartini valued her Dutch friends, and
        recognised that they held different and more enlightened views than many
        of their countrymen and women on the colonial project, as Hildred Geertz
        observes in her 1963 introduction to Letters of a Javanese Princess, she
        became increasingly keen to affirm Java’s ancient and rich civilisation
        as of ‘the highest value’, and something that ‘should not be abandoned
        for a shallow modernity’ (9).

        The letters offer a snapshot of the interdependence of the Dutch
        colonisers and Java’s gentry as well as Kartini and Roekmini’s ongoing
        campaign to secure further education and training. Although almost
        succeeding in achieving this dream (first in Holland, and then in
        Jakarta), a combination of powerful forces highlighted innumerable risks
        in going ahead with their plan. The emotionality of the texts highlights
        the embodied materiality of family and daily life, Javanese cultural
        practices and politics, and the impacts of recurrent ill health, both
        physical and emotional, within their family. Time and again, Kartini
        reflects on the stratification of Javanese society under Dutch
        colonisation as well as her growing sense of an urgent need for Java to
        modernise which the colonial administration was not keen to advance.

        In just four years, Kartini showed that emotions are dangerous. Emotions
        move her in her struggle for education for women and for the Javanese to
        innovation. Emotions – anger, shame, humiliation, grief and despair –
        must be felt and faced, and when that is done, she is able to move
        beyond decrying injustice to finding new pathways. This is why her felt
        passion and activism, clarity and perception, continue to resonate
        because, as Sara Ahmed argues, ‘The emotional struggles against
        injustice are … about how we are moved by feelings into a different
        relation to the norms that we wish to contest, or the wounds we wish to
        heal’ (201).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kartini’s expressions of emotion to her friends and mentors arise out of
        layers of injustice and inequality. They lead her to a consciousness of
        what needs to be done and set in motion the steps to its accomplishment.
        Her European interlocutors encourage her dreams and offer a community of
        belief and moral and practical support. The most direct and measurable
        achievement will be the setting up of a string of schools for girls.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is because Kartini’s letters have survived and remained in
        circulation that her voice as one of Indonesia’s first feminists
        continues to speak to the present. Kartini and the ‘Clover Leaf’ and
        their two younger sisters had an active role in educating and inspiring
        later generations of feminists and nationalists, and laid the foundation
        for the emergence of the Indonesian Women’s Movement (Gerwani) in the
        early 1950s, which grew to an estimated 3 million members by 1965.[2] In
        1964 Kartini was recognised by President Soekarno as a national hero
        (pahlawan national) and every year on her birthday — 21 April –
        Indonesia celebrates Kartini Day. Like all dangerous women, however,
        while her legacy has been poured over –and debated, contested,
        neglected, reinvented and co-opted — it remains a powerful reminder that
        changing society is both difficult and possible.
