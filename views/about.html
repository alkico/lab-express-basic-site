    <h1>About Kartini</h1>

      <p>
        Kartini’s powerful feminist, intellectual and nationalist legacy was
        created between 25 May 1899 and 14 September 1904. During that time,
        Kartini wrote to more than ten Dutch socialists, feminists and
        educationalists and, following her untimely death in childbirth in 1904,
        her letters were collected and published in Holland (in 1911), and in
        English in 1920.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her letters, Kartini speaks to and exposes the social relations of
        power within the Javanese aristocracy and the Netherlands East Indies
        (NEI) colonial system, and presses the case for: Javanese education (for
        girls especially), an end to polygamy, greater agency for women in
        choosing a career and/or marriage, the training of more Javanese
        teachers, midwives and doctors, and the end of colonial domination and
        exploitation. While Kartini did not live to benefit from or achieve many
        of the changes she dreamed of and set in motion, her four younger
        sisters – – Roekmini (1880-1951), Kardinah (1881-1971), Kartinah
        (1883-?) and Soematri (1888-1963) — became active proponents of the
        changes they collectively sought. And, arguably, her dream of freedom
        for the Javanese, which began as a trickle in her letters, and developed
        into a flow by the 1920s, turned into a torrent after the Japanese
        surrender and withdrawal from the Dutch East Indies in 1945.

        Kartini was born in Jepara on the north coast of Central Java on 21
        April 1879 and as the title, Raden Adjeng, indicates, she was part of an
        aristocratic Javanese family that was integral to the Dutch colonial
        administration. Her father, the Regent of Jepara, who was educated by a
        Dutch tutor in the 1860s, spoke Dutch fluently and was widely read in
        Western literature. He too educated his children, and so, from the age
        of six, Kartini and her sisters attended a Dutch elementary school
        where, on becoming sensitised to the cultural differences between
        European and Javanese ways of being, they fixed on having the same
        freedoms to follow a career as their Dutch schoolgirl friends. A central
        aspect of Kartini’s life was the inspired hope shared with Kardinah and
        Roekmini – the two younger sisters closest to her in age — that
        modernity would deliver vocational training and meaningful paid work to
        Java’s women, and this would allow them to actively engage in the social
        and economic development of their country.

        After taking out a subscription to the magazine, Kartini placed an ad
        for a penfriend and so began a correspondence with the radical Dutch
        feminist, Stella Zeehandelaar. A year later, in 1900, she met and began
        corresponding with J. H. Abendanon, the Director of Education, Industry
        and Religion in Java (from 4 March 1900 until 4 March 1905) and his
        Spanish wife, Rosita Abendanon-Mandri. For Kartini, letter writing was a
        means of creative expression that linked her to a cosmopolitan world of
        books and philosophical ideas, and helped her to make meaning in
        relation to the embodied experiences of the family’s everyday lives. In
        the opening lines of her first letter to Stella Zeehandelaar (SZ), dated
        25 May 1899, Kartini articulated her passionate desire to embrace
        modernity. She had just turned twenty.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Feminism and Nationalism, Kartini describes to Stella how, when she
        turned sixteen, the family finally broke with tradition and allowed the
        three sisters out into public again so they could attend festivities for
        the investiture of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. While her
        parents’ unconventional move did not pass unnoticed in society at the
        time, for Kartini the concession did not go far enough: No, attending
        festivities or amusements were not what I had yearned for … I longed to
        be free to be able to be independent, to be able to make myself
        independent, not to have to be dependent on anyone, [and] … never to
        have to marry.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The painful reality for the sisters was that tradition required that
        they marry and, as well as being denied the right to choose or even
        meeting their husband beforehand, there was also the Javanese
        aristocratic norm of polygamy which she deplored. And who does not do
        this? And why would they not do so? It is no crime, nor is it a scandal…
        And can you imagine what hellish pain a woman must experience when her
        husband comes home with another whom she has to recognise as his lawful
        wife, her rival? He can torment her to death, mistreat her as much as he
        likes for as long as he chooses not to give her her freedom again; she
        can whistle to the wind for her rights! Everything for the man and
        nothing for the woman is our law and general belief. (Letter to SZ, 6
        November 1899, On Feminism and Nationalism, 34-35).

        Although not revealed to Stella, the ‘Clover Leaf’ knew first hand the
        suffering within families due to the polygamous marriage arrangement
        because their own father had two wives: the woman Kartini called
        ‘mother’ was her step mother and the official first wife (Raden Ayu);
        and her biological mother was the second wife (selir). Kartini’s ethical
        stance in her letters brings the collision between the public and
        private into focus when it becomes clear that ‘not only was there a real
        sense in which Kartini had to change the world to free herself, but that
        also personal autonomy had no moral meaning for Kartini if it were not
        projected as a universal right and ideal’ (Coté Letters from Kartini
        xvii). As her translator, Joost Coté, argues, Kartini strove to choose
        her own path, to assert her autonomy, and it is this ‘chosen value’ that
        ‘launches her into the uncertain ground of modernity’ (xxi).
